🐍 Python is a high-level, versatile programming language that's designed to be easy to read, write, and understand
-> Python is Dynamic :-No Type Declaration Needed You don’t need to say what type a variable is
EG:
x = 5         # Python treats 'x' as an integer
x = "hello"   # Now 'x' is a string
🧱 In Python, it requires indentation .
🐍Python Interpreter & Shell (REPL)
->Python is an interpreted language, which means it executes code line by line using an interpreter.
💻 Shell
Refers to the interface or tool where the REPL happens.
When you type python or python3 in the terminal and see >>>, you're inside the Python Shell.
🧪 REPL (Read–Eval–Print Loop)
REPL stands for:
📥 Read your input (the Python code you type)
🤖 Evaluate the code
📤 Print the result
🔁 Loop back and wait for the next command

🛠️ Useful Methods & Functions in Python REPL
🧮 Built-in Functions
These work anywhere — including REPL!
>print() – display output
>type() – check the type of a variable
>len() – get the length of strings, lists, etc.
>Input() – capture user input
>abs() – absolute value
>round() – round a number
>max(), min() – find highest/lowest values
>sum() – total values in a list or tuple
>sorted() – return a sorted version of a sequence
>help() – get help on any object or module
>dir() – list attributes/methods of object

🧠 PEP 8
->📘 PEP 8 (Python Enhancement Proposal 8) is the official style guide for writing clean and consistent Python code.
🧼 1. Code Layout
Use 4 spaces per indentation level (avoid tabs unless configured properly).
Keep each line within 79 characters for better readability.
Separate top-level functions and classes using 2 blank lines to organize code visually.
🧬 2. Naming Conventions
1)snake_case (variables, functions, methods, modules):
This involves using lowercase letters for all words and separating them with underscores. For example: my_variable, calculate_area, process_data.
2)PascalCase (classes):
Each word in the class name starts with a capital letter, with no underscores. For example: MyClass, HTTPResponse, BankAccount.
3)ALL_CAPS (constants):
All letters are capitalized, and words are separated by underscores. For example: MAX_CONNECTIONS, PI, DEBUG_MODE.

🧠 Static vs Dynamic Typing — Key Concepts
🔒 Statically Typed Languages
Definition: Type of each variable is determined at compile time.

Type Declaration: Often required by the programmer (e.g., int x = 10; in C). Some modern statically typed languages support type inference (e.g., Kotlin, Scala, Haskell).

Error Checking: The compiler performs strict type checking before execution — reducing runtime errors.

Common Use Cases: Large, complex systems where safety and performance matter (e.g., enterprise software, systems programming).

Examples: C, C++, Java, Rust, Go, Scala, Kotlin, Haskell

✅ Advantages
Catch type errors early in the development cycle

Better tooling, optimization, and IDE support

Easier to enforce contracts and interfaces across teams

🔓 Dynamically Typed Languages
Definition: Variable types are determined at runtime, based on the actual data held.

Type Declaration: Not required — the interpreter assigns types on the fly.

Flexibility: Allows faster development and prototyping but may lead to hidden bugs if types change unexpectedly.

Common Use Cases: Scripting, automation, rapid app development, small to medium-sized projects.

Examples: Python, JavaScript, Ruby, PHP, Perl, Erlang

✅ Advantages
Quick and flexible coding — ideal for beginners or fast iterations

Cleaner syntax and fewer boilerplate declarations

Excellent for interactive use (e.g., REPL environments)

what is array?
 An array is a data structure used to store a collection of items—typically of the same type—in a single, organized unit. 
It’s like a row of labeled boxes where each box holds a value and you can access them by index. 📦

📦 What Is a Structured Array?
A structured array is a type of NumPy array where each element can have multiple fields, like a row in a database or a record in a table. 
Each field has a name and its own data type.
EG-[ ('Alice', 25, 5.5), ('Bob', 30, 6.1), ... ]
Where each row has:
A name (string),
An age (integer),
A height (float)
✅ Benefits of Structured Arrays
->You can store and work with tabular data efficiently.
->Each column (field) can have its own type.
->Helpful for data analysis, machine learning, and working with datasets.

LIST 
🧾 Definition:
->A list is an ordered collection of items, which can be changed (mutable), and it allows duplicate values.

 🎯 Key Features of Lists

max() returns the largest value from a list or iterable.
min() returns the smallest value from a list or iterable.
->🔹 Using key Parameter:
You can use key= to customize how values are compared.
words = ["hi", "hello", "hey"]
print(max(words, key=len))  # → hello
print(min(words, key=len))  # → hi

# List comprehension
squares = [x**2 for x in range(5)]  # → [0, 1, 4, 9, 16]

🧠 Tuples 
🔹 What Is a Tuple?
->A tuple is an immutable, ordered sequence of elements.
->Defined using parentheses () or without them (but comma is essential).

EG:
t1 = (1, 2, 3)
t2 = 1, 2, 3  # also a tuple

🔹 Key Properties

Immutable	              Cannot change after creation
Allow Duplicates       	Yes
Can Store Mixed Types  	Yes (int, str, list, etc.)

🔹Tuple Creation
Empty tuple: t = ()
Single element: t = (5,) (comma is necessary)
Nested tuples: t = (1, (2, 3), 4).

🔹Accessing Elements
Indexing: t for the first element, t[-1] for the last.
Slicing: t[1:4] gives a new tuple with elements from index 1 to 3.
Nested access: t[1] for nested tuples.

🔹Basic Tuple Operations

Length               	len(t)	                         Number of elements
Unpacking	            a, b = (1, 2)	                  Assign tuple elements to variables

🔹Tuple Functions & Methods
Function/Method     Purpose                     	            Example
len(t)	             Returns the number of items	             len((1,2,3)) → 3
max(t)             	Returns the largest item	                max((1,3,2)) → 3
min(t)              Returns the smallest item	               min((1,3,2)) → 1
sum(t)             	Returns the sum of elements(if numeric)	 sum((1,2,3)) → 6
count(x)	           how many times "x" appears               (1,2,2,3).count(2) → 2

sort() Method       modifies the original list               SYNTAX = list(sorted(TUP1,key=None, reverse=False)
zip()               to pair up elements from all tuples

 #IF TUPLE CONVERTED TO LIST ,IT CAN BE CHANGED OR MUTABLE
🔹Tuple Packing and Unpacking in Python
1. Tuple Packing
->Definition: Packing is the process of combining multiple values into a single tuple.
->How: Assigning multiple comma-separated values to a single variable automatically creates a tuple.

2. Tuple Unpacking
->Definition: Unpacking extracts the individual elements of a tuple into separate variables.
->Requirement: The number of variables on the left must match the number of elements in the tuple,
unless using extended unpacking.

3. Extended Unpacking with *
->Allows capturing multiple elements into a list during unpacking.
->Useful when the number of variables is fewer than the number of tuple elements.

🔹Python range() 
What is range()?
The range() function generates an immutable sequence of integers.
It is commonly used for looping a specific number of times or generating a sequence of numbers.
SYNTAX:
range(stop)
range(start, stop)
range(start, stop, step)

🔹Tuple comprehension
->Tuple comprehension	Not supported directly	(x for x in iterable) is a generator
->Imitate with list comp	tuple([x for x in iterable])	Creates tuple from list comprehension
->Imitate with generator	tuple(x for x in iterable)	Creates tuple from generator expression

Tuple Comprehension in Python: Accurate Notes
1. No Direct Tuple Comprehension Syntax
Python does not support direct tuple comprehension like list, set, or dictionary comprehensions.
Writing (x for x in iterable) creates a generator expression, not a tuple.
This is because tuples are immutable and cannot be built incrementally like lists or sets.

2. How to Create Tuples Using Comprehension-Like Syntax
You can imitate tuple comprehension by using:
List comprehension inside the tuple() constructor, or
Generator expression inside the tuple() constructor.


🔑key Function()
The key parameter is used in functions like sorted(), max(), min(), etc.,
to specify a function that will be applied to each element before comparison.
-> DEFINES ON WHAT BASIS ? 
EG : key == len # means to operate on basis of length

🧱SETS
->Unordered, mutable collection of unique elements
->Defined with curly braces {} or using set() constructor
->Duplicate elements are automatically removed
EG:
A = {1, 2, 3}
B = set([2, 3, 4])
 
➕ Adding Elements to a Set
1)add() – Adds a single element
EG:
A = {1, 2}
A.add(3)
# A becomes {1, 2, 3}

2)update() – Adds multiple elements (from list, set, tuple, etc.)
EG:
A.update([4, 5])
# A becomes {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}

➖ Removing Elements from a Set
3)remove() – Removes specific item (error if not found)
EG:
A.remove(2)  # KeyError if 2 not in A

4)discard() – Removes item if present (no error if not)
EG:
A.discard(10)  # Safe even if 10 is not in A

5)pop() – Removes and returns a random element
EG:
val = A.pop()  # Element removed randomly

6)clear() – Removes all elements
EG:
A.clear()

🧮 Set Operations  
Operation            	                Syntax	                                    Description
Union(ALL ELEMENTS)              `A  orA.union(B)`                      	  Combines all elements
Intersection(COMMON IN BOTH)  	   A & B or A.intersection(B)	              Common elements only
Difference                       	A - B or A.difference(B)	                Items in A but not in B
Symmetric Diff(UNIQUE ELEMENTS)	  A ^ B or A.symmetric_difference(B)    	  Items in A or B but not both
Subset Check	                     A <= B or A.issubset(B)                 	A is contained in B
Superset Check	                   A >= B or A.issuperset(B)	               B is contained in A
Disjoint Check	                   A.isdisjoint(B)	                         No common elements

1️⃣ Union – Combines all unique elements
EG:
A = {1, 2, 3}
B = {3, 4, 5}

print("Union:", A | B)  # or A.union(B)
# Output: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
✅ Useful for merging datasets without duplicates.

2️⃣ Intersection – Finds common elements
EG:
print("Intersection:", A & B)  # or A.intersection(B)
# Output: {3}
✅ Helps find overlap in choices, preferences, or results.

3️⃣ Difference – Elements in A not in B
EG:
print("A - B:", A - B)  # or A.difference(B)
# Output: {1, 2}
✅ Great for finding unique entries or exclusions.

4️⃣ Symmetric Difference – Elements in either set but not both
EG:
print("Symmetric Difference:", A ^ B)  # or A.symmetric_difference(B)
# Output: {1, 2, 4, 5}
✅ Identifies mismatches or disjoint items.

5️⃣ Subset & Superset Checks
EG:
C = {1, 2}
print("C is subset of A:", C.issubset(A))      # True
print("A is superset of C:", A.issuperset(C))  # True
✅ Important in permissions, group hierarchies, and filtering.

6️⃣ Disjoint Check – No common elements
EG:
D = {10, 11}
print("A and D are disjoint:", A.isdisjoint(D))  # True

 🧠 Quick Notes for Interviews
->Sets are unordered, so indexing/slicing doesn't work.
->Use sets for membership tests, duplicate removal, and fast comparisons.
->set() on a string or list removes duplicates.
->Ideal for solving problems like:
->Finding unique items
->Checking overlap
->Counting distinct values

🧠 Set Comprehension
->Set comprehension is a concise way to create sets from iterable data sources using a single line of code, following the pattern:
->SYNTAX:
{expression for item in iterable if condition}

->Similar to list comprehension, but uses {} to build a set
->Automatically removes duplicates
->Only includes items that meet the specified condition

🧠 Basic Built-in Functions for Sets
Function          	Description
len(set)	          Returns number of elements
max(set)	          Largest value in set
min(set)	          Smallest value in set
sum(set)	          Sum of all elements
sorted(set)	       Returns sorted list
any(set)	          True if at least one item is truthy
all(set)	          True if all items are truthy
enumerate(set)    	Returns index-value pairs
list(set)	         Converts set to list
tuple(set)        	Converts set to tuple

🧊Frozenset
->It’s an immutable set — once created, you can’t change it.
->Like a regular set, it stores unique, unordered elements.
->Can be used as a dictionary key or element in another set (regular sets cannot).
EG:
fs = frozenset([1, 2, 3, 2])
print(fs)  # Output: frozenset({1, 2, 3})

✅ Key Features
Property	             Regular Set	              Frozenset
Mutable	              ✅ Yes                   	❌ No
Hashable	             ❌ No                    	✅ Yes
Allows duplicates	    ❌ No	                    ❌ No
Uses curly braces	    ✅ Yes	                   ❌ No (use frozenset())

🔒 What You CAN Do with a Frozenset
1)len(fs) – Count items

2)min(fs), max(fs) – Get smallest/largest

3)fs.union(...), fs.intersection(...), fs.difference(...) – Set operations

4)fs.isdisjoint(...), fs.issubset(...), fs.issuperset(...)

🚫 What You CAN’T Do
1)No add(), remove(), pop(), clear()

2)No updates — it’s frozen!

🧠 Dictionary 
->A dictionary is a built-in Python data structure that stores data as key-value pairs.
->Keys must be unique and immutable (e.g., strings, numbers, tuples).
->Values can be of any data type, including other dictionaries.
->From Python 3.7+, dictionaries maintain insertion order.

SYNTAX:
{key1: value1, key2: value2, ...}
EG:
my_dict = {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 30, 'skills': ['Python', 'SQL']}

🔑 Key Characteristics of Python Dictionaries
Characteristic	                   Description
1)Mutable	                   You can add, update, or delete items after creation.
2)Ordered (Python ≥ 3.7)    	Maintains insertion order of items.
3)Uniqueness	                Keys must be unique; duplicate keys overwrite previous values.
4)Immutability	              Keys must be immutable types (e.g., strings, numbers, tuples).
5)Value Flexibility	         Values can be of any data type, including other dictionaries.
6)Fast Lookup	               Uses hashing for constant-time access to values via keys.
7)Indexed by Keys	           Accessed using keys, not numerical indices like lists.
8)Case Sensitivity	          Keys are case-sensitive: 'Name' and 'name' are treated as different

🛠️ Common Operations
1) Creating a dictionary
person = {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 30}

2) Accessing values
i>print(person['name'])           # Output: Alice
ii>print(person.get('city', 'N/A'))  # Output: N/A

3) Adding/updating
person['city'] = 'Indore'

4) Removing items
i>del person['age']
ii>person.pop('city')
iii>person.clear()  # Removes all items

🧰 Dictionary Methods
Method	          Description
->clear()	         Removes all items
->copy()	          Returns a shallow copy
->fromkeys()	      Creates dictionary from keys with default value
->get(key)	        Returns value for key or None if not found
->items()	         Returns view object of key-value pairs
->keys()	          Returns view object of keys
->values()	        Returns view object of values
->pop(key)	        Removes item with specified key and returns its value
->popitem()	       Removes and returns last inserted key-value pair
->setdefault()	    Returns value of key; inserts key with default if not found
->update()	        Updates dictionary with another dictionary or iterable of key-value pairs

🔁 Basic Iteration Techniques
1. Iterate Over Keys (Default Behavior)
EG:
my_dict = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}
for key in my_dict:
    print(key)
This loops through all the keys in the dictionary.

2. Iterate Over Keys Explicitly
EG:
for key in my_dict.keys():
    print(key)
Same as above, but more explicit.

3. Iterate Over Values
EG:
for value in my_dict.values():
    print(value)
Loops through all the values.

4. Iterate Over Key-Value Pairs
EG:
for key, value in my_dict.items():
    print(f"{key}: {value}")
Most common way to access both keys and values simultaneously.

🧪 Advanced Iteration Techniques

5. Using enumerate() for Index Tracking
EG:
for index, (key, value) in enumerate(my_dict.items()):
    print(f"{index}: {key} -> {value}")

6. Using zip() to Pair Keys and Values
EG:
for key, value in zip(my_dict.keys(), my_dict.values()):
    print(f"{key}: {value}")

7. Dictionary Comprehension
EG:
squared = {key: value**2 for key, value in my_dict.items()}
Creates a new dictionary by applying logic during iteration.


🔹Method	        Removes...	                    Returns...	               Error if Missing?
i)pop(key)	      Specific key-value pair	       Value	                    Yes (unless default)
ii)popitem()	    Last inserted item	            Tuple(key, value)	        Yes (if empty)


⭐Merging Two Dictionary

🔧 1. update() Method

EG:
dict1 = {'a': 1, 'b': 2}
dict2 = {'b': 3, 'c': 4}

dict1.update(dict2)
print(dict1)  # {'a': 1, 'b': 3, 'c': 4}

->Modifies dict1 in place.
->Overwrites values if keys overlap.

🧩 2. Dictionary Unpacking (**)

EG:
dict3 = {**dict1, **dict2}
Creates a new dictionary.

->Available from Python 3.5+.
->Later keys overwrite earlier ones.

🧱 3. Merge Operator (|)

EG:
dict3 = dict1 | dict2
Introduced in Python 3.9+.

->Returns a new dictionary.
->Overlapping keys take values from the right-hand dictionary.

🔁 4. Loop-Based Merge

EG:
merged = dict1.copy()
for k, v in dict2.items():
    merged[k] = v

->Useful for custom merge logic.
->Works in all Python versions.

🧠Nested Dictionary
->A nested dictionary is a dictionary where values themselves are dictionaries. This structure allows you to represent hierarchical or grouped data.

EG:
students = {
    "student1": {"name": "Ariana", "age": 20, "grade": "A"},
    "student2": {"name": "Travis", "age": 22, "grade": "B"}
}

🛠️ Creating Nested Dictionaries
1. Direct Assignment
EG:
data = {
    "item1": {"price": 100, "stock": 20},
    "item2": {"price": 150, "stock": 35}
}

2. Using Loops
EG:
nested = {}
for i in range(3):
    nested[i] = {"value": i * 10}


3)🔍 Accessing Elements
EG:
print(students["student1"]["name"])  # Output: Ariana
print(students.get("student2", {}).get("grade", "N/A"))  # Output: B
Use .get() to avoid KeyError when accessing nested keys.

4)✏️ Modifying Nested Dictionaries
EG:
students["student1"]["grade"] = "A+"
students["student3"] = {"name": "Luna", "age": 21, "grade": "A"}

5)❌ Deleting Elements
EG:
del students["student2"]["age"]       # Remove inner key
del students["student3"]              # Remove entire entry

6)🔁 Iterating Through Nested Dictionaries
EG:
for student_id, info in students.items():
    print(f"\n{student_id}:")
    for key, value in info.items():
        print(f"  {key}: {value}")

🧭 Dictionary Key Sorting in Python (No lambda, No def)

✅ 1. Basic: Sort by Keys (Ascending Order)
EG:

d = {'c': 3, 'a': 1, 'b': 2}
sorted_dict = dict(sorted(d.items()))
Uses sorted() on .items()

->Automatically sorts by keys
->Converts back to dictionary using dict()

✅ 2. Sort by Keys in Descending Order
EG:

sorted_dict = dict(sorted(d.items(), reverse=True))
->reverse=True sorts keys from highest to lowest

✅ 3. Sort Dictionary by Keys using List Comprehension
EG:

sorted_dict = {k: d[k] for k in sorted(d)}
->Creates a new dict sorted by keys (ascending)
->Efficient for quick logic without .items()

EXPLANATION:

d = {'banana': 3, 'apple': 1, 'cherry': 2}

->What's Happening Step-by-Step:
->sorted(d) gives you a sorted list of keys: ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
->For each key k, you grab its value using d[k]
->{k: d[k] for ...} builds a new dictionary, one key-value pair at a time
->Done! You now have a sorted dictionary: {'apple': 1, 'banana': 3, 'cherry': 2}

✅ 4. Sort Dictionary by Keys with Comprehension (Descending)
EG:

sorted_dict = {k: d[k] for k in sorted(d, reverse=True)}
->Works the same as above, but in reverse key order


🔢 Dictionary Value Sorting Techniques
Let’s use this sample dictionary:
EG:
d = {'apple': 40, 'banana': 10, 'cherry': 25}

✅ 1. Using operator.itemgetter() (No lambda, No def)
EG:

import operator
sorted_dict = dict(sorted(d.items(), key=operator.itemgetter(1)))
Grabs the second item (value) from each pair

reverse=True adds descending order

✅ 2. Using lambda (Inline Function)
EG:

sorted_dict = dict(sorted(d.items(), key=lambda item: item[1]))
Most commonly used in quick scripts

Can sort by custom logic too (item[1] % 10, etc.)

✅ 3. Using def Function (Custom Key Extractor)
EG:

def get_value(pair):
    return pair[1]

sorted_dict = dict(sorted(d.items(), key=get_value))
Clearer when sorting logic is reused or complex

Supports descending with reverse=True

✅ 4. Using Dictionary Comprehension
EG:

sorted_dict = {k: v for k, v in sorted(d.items(), key=lambda item: item[1])}
Wraps sorted result into a new dictionary

Descending: reverse=True in sorted()

✅ 5. Sorting Only Values (No Keys)
EG:

sorted_values = sorted(d.values())
Returns list of values in order

Doesn’t retain key association — more useful for value analysis

✅ 6. Sort Dictionary with Nested Values
EG:

nested = {
    'item1': {'score': 82},
    'item2': {'score': 96}
}

import operator
sorted_nested = dict(sorted(nested.items(), key=lambda x: x[1]['score']))
Sorts based on inner field like 'score'

🐍 Python Functions 
->Python functions are reusable blocks of code designed to perform a specific task. 
->They help in modularizing code, improving readability, and reducing redundancy.
->They help break big problems into smaller parts and are very useful in real-world programming

🔍 Key Concepts
1. Function Definition
EG:
def function_name(parameters):
    # code block
    return result
->def: Keyword to define a function
->function_name: Identifier for the function
->parameters: Optional inputs
->return: Optional output

2. Function Calling
EG:
function_name(arguments)

3. Types of Functions
->Built-in functions: len(), print(), type(), etc.
->User-defined functions: Created using def
->Lambda functions: Anonymous, single-expression functions

4. Arguments
->Positional arguments: Based on order
->Keyword arguments: Specified by name
->Default arguments: Have default values
->Variable-length arguments:
  *args: Non-keyword variable arguments
  **kwargs: Keyword variable arguments

5. Return Statement
->Returns a value from the function.The return statement is used inside a function to send a result back to the caller. 
->It also ends the function’s execution immediately.
->Can return multiple values as a tuple
EG:
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

result = add(3, 5)
print(result)  # Output: 8

⚠️ Important Notes
-> after a return statement won’t run.
->You can use multiple return statements in a function, but only one will execute depending on the logic.
->Functions always return something—either a value or None.

💡 Best Practices
->Use return to make your functions reusable and testable.
->Avoid using print() inside functions when you need to use the result elsewhere—use return instead.
->Document what your function returns using docstrings.

6. Scope
->Local scope: Variables inside a function
->Global scope: Variables outside all functions
->Use global keyword to modify global variables inside a function

7. Docstrings
->Used for documentation.
->A docstring (short for documentation string) is a special kind of string used to describe 
->what a function, class, or module does. It helps others (and your future self!) understand your code.
SYNTAX : " " OR """ """
EG:
def greet():
    """This function greets the user."""
    print("Hello!")

🧩pass Func()
->It does nothing when executed.
->It’s used to avoid errors in places where Python expects a statement.
->Commonly used in empty functions, classes, loops, or conditionals.


🔢 Positional Arguments
->These are arguments passed to a function in the exact order the parameters are defined.

✅ Example:
def greet(name, age):
    print(f"Hello {name}, you are {age} years old.")

greet("Alice", 25)  # 'Alice' goes to name, 25 goes to age

->The first value goes to the first parameter, the second to the second, and so on.
->Order matters — swapping values can lead to unexpected results.

🏷️ Keyword Arguments
->These are passed by explicitly naming the parameter, so order doesn’t matter.
✅ Example:

def greet(name, age):
    print(f"Hello {name}, you are {age} years old.")

greet(age=25, name="Alice")  # Works fine!
 
->You specify which value goes to which parameter.
->Makes the function call more readable and flexible.

🔀 Mixing Positional and Keyword Arguments
->You can mix both, but positional arguments must come first.
✅ Valid:
greet("Alice", age=25)

❌ Invalid:
greet(age=25, "Alice")  # SyntaxError: positional argument follows keyword argument

💡 Best Practices
->Use positional arguments when the meaning is obvious and order is clear.
->Use keyword arguments for clarity, especially with many parameters.
->Avoid mixing too many types unless necessary.

🧩Default Arguments
->Default arguments are values you assign to function parameters in advance,
->so if the caller doesn’t provide them, Python uses the defaults.

🔍 Example:
def show_info(name, city="Hyderabad"):
    print("Name:", name)
    print("City:", city)

show_info("Ansh", "Delhi")   # Output: Name: Ansh, City: Delhi
show_info("Shrey")           # Output: Name: Shrey, City: Hyderabad
In the second call, city wasn’t provided, so it used the default "Hyderabad".

⚠️ Important Rules
->Default arguments must come after non-default ones.
EG:
def func(a, b=2):  # ✅ Valid
def func(a=1, b):  # ❌ Invalid

->You can override defaults by passing values explicitly.
->Be careful with mutable defaults like lists or dictionaries—they persist across calls!

📦 Variable-Length Arguments in Python
->Variable-length arguments allow functions to accept a flexible number of inputs. Python provides two ways:
->*args for non-keyword (positional) arguments
->**kwargs for keyword arguments

✅ 1. *args – Arbitrary Positional Arguments
🔹 Purpose:
->Allows a function to receive any number of positional arguments, packaged as a tuple.

🔹 Syntax:
def function_name(*args):
    # args is a tuple

🔹 EG:
def add_all(*numbers):
    return sum(numbers)

->add_all(1, 2, 3, 4)  # Output: 10

🔹 Notes:
->You can iterate over args using a loop.
->Useful when argument count may vary.

✅ 2. **kwargs – Arbitrary Keyword Arguments
🔹 Purpose:
->Allows a function to receive any number of keyword arguments, packed as a dictionary.

🔹 Syntax:
def function_name(**kwargs):
    # kwargs is a dict

🔹 EG:
def display_info(**details):
    for key, value in details.items():
        print(f"{key}: {value}")

display_info(name="Alice", age=25)

🔹 Notes:
->Use .items() to access keys and values.
->Useful for flexible configuration or optional parameters.

🔀 Combining *args and **kwargs
->You can use both in the same function, but the order matters.

EG:
def example_func(arg1, *args, **kwargs):
    print("arg1:", arg1)
    print("args:", args)
    print("kwargs:", kwargs)
🎯 Rule: *args must come before **kwargs

⚠️ Best Practices & Tips
->Name them clearly (*args, **kwargs) for convention, but you can rename (e.g., *items, **options).
->Use when writing utility functions, wrappers, or building APIs.
->Handle them carefully to avoid confusion between fixed and flexible parameters.
->Use default values or validation when needed.

🧪 Interview Questions & Examples
Question	Sample Answer
What is *args used for?	Accepts extra positional arguments in a function.
What does **kwargs return?	A dictionary of keyword arguments.
Can you use both together?	Yes. Syntax: def func(a, *args, **kwargs)
How are values accessed in **kwargs?	Using .items() method for key-value pairs.

🧠 Quick Summary
Type	What It Does	Stored As
Positional	Matches values by order	Variables
Keyword	Matches values by parameter name	Variables
*args	Packs extra positional arguments	Tuple
**kwargs	Packs extra keyword arguments	Dictionary

🔁 Recursive Functions in Python
✅ What Is Recursion?
->Recursion is when a function calls itself to solve a smaller version of the same problem.
->It continues until it reaches a base case, which stops the recursion.

🧩 Structure of a Recursive Function
def recursive_function(parameters):
    if base_case_condition:
        return result
    else:
        return recursive_function(modified_parameters)

->Base Case: Stops the recursion.
->Recursive Case: Calls the function again with updated input.

🔍 Example: Factorial Using Recursion
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n - 1)

print(factorial(5))  # Output: 120

->factorial(5) calls factorial(4), then factorial(3), and so on until factorial(0).

🧠 Key Concepts
Term	                 Meaning
Base Case	            Condition where recursion stops (e.g., n == 0)
Recursive Case	       Function calls itself with smaller input (e.g., factorial(n-1))
Stack	                Each recursive call is stored in memory until the base case is reached
RecursionError       	Happens if recursion goes too deep without stopping

✅ lambda Function OR Anonymous Function()

->In Python, an anonymous function is created using the lambda keyword.
->It’s called “anonymous” because it’s defined without a name.
->These are typically used for small, short-lived functions.
->Think of lambda as a compact way to write small functions, especially when you don't want to use a full def block.
EG:
1)
add = lambda x, y: x + y
print(add(3, 5))  # Output: 8

2)🌀 Sorting with lambda:
data = [('apple', 3), ('banana', 1), ('cherry', 2)]
sorted_data = sorted(data, key=lambda x: x[1])
print(sorted_data)  # Sorted by number

🧹filter()
->The filter() function is used to filter items out of an iterable (like a list or tuple) based on a condition.
->It returns only the elements that satisfy the condition provided by a function.

🛠️ Syntax

filter(function, iterable)
->function: A function that returns True or False
->iterable: The collection you want to filter (e.g. list, tuple)
->It returns a filter object—you often convert this to a list like list(filter(...)).

->SIMPLY:filter() takes a function (like a lambda) and an iterable (like a list), and keeps only the items where the function returns True.

✅ Examples
1. Filter Even Numbers

nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
evens = list(filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, nums))
print(evens)  # Output: [2, 4, 6]


🔄 Map()
->The map() function applies a given function to every item in an iterable (like a list or tuple) and returns a new iterable (usually converted to a list).

🛠️ Syntax:
map(function, iterable)
->function – a function that defines how each item should be transformed
->iterable – the collection you want to transform

->⚠️ Like filter(), the result is a special object—use list() or tuple() to view it.

✅ Examples
1. 📌 Double Each Number

nums = [1, 2, 3, 4]
doubled = list(map(lambda x: x * 2, nums))
print(doubled)  # Output: [2, 4, 6, 8]

2. 🔠 Format Names

names = ["alice", "BOB", "CharLie"]
formatted = list(map(lambda name: name.title(), names))
print(formatted)  # Output: ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie']

🧠Reduce()
->The reduce() function takes a function and a sequence and applies the function cumulatively to the items in the sequence. It's like saying:
->“Take the first two items, apply the function. Then take that result and the next item, apply the function again... until you’ve gone through the whole list.”

->🔔 Note: It lives in the functools module, so you have to import it first.

🛠️ Syntax

from functools import reduce
reduce(function, iterable)
->function: Must take two arguments
->iterable: A list, tuple, or any sequence

1.✖️ Product of All Numbers
EG:
from functools import reduce
nums = [1, 2, 3, 4]
product = reduce(lambda x, y: x * y, nums)
print(product)  # Output: 24

🎯 When to Use reduce()
Use it when:
->You want to accumulate(TOGETHER) or collapse a sequence into a single result
->The operation is repetitive and binary (like adding, multiplying, comparing)
->You want concise code instead of looping manually.

🧠 What Is a Nested Function?
->A nested function is a function that’s defined inside another function. It's like one function hiding inside another—just like nesting dolls!
->This is useful when:
I)You want a helper function that’s used only within a larger one
II)You need to encapsulate logic or protect scope
III)You’re dealing with closures or decorators

🛠️ Syntax EG:

def outer_function(x):
    def inner_function(y):
        return y * 2
    result = inner_function(x)
    return result + 1

print(outer_function(5))  # Output: 11

Explanation:
->inner_function is defined inside outer_function
->It’s only accessible within the outer_function
->outer_function uses it and then does its own logic

✅ Real-Life Analogy
->Imagine you're making a pizza (outer_function). 
->You use a sauce recipe (inner_function) that’s not shared outside the kitchen—it helps make the pizza perfect, but no one uses it separately.

🧪 Advanced Use: Closures
If the inner function uses variables from the outer function and returns itself, it becomes a closure.

def make_multiplier(factor):
    def multiply(x):
        return x * factor
    return multiply

double = make_multiplier(2)
print(double(5))  # Output: 10

🎯 Key Takeaways
->Nested functions help with scope and organization
->They’re essential for building closures and decorators
->You can’t access an inner function outside its outer function unless it's returned


🧠 1. Local Variable
->A variable defined inside a function and accessible only within that function.

🔍 Example:

def greet():
    message = "Hello!"  # local variable
    print(message)

greet()
# print(message)  # ❌ Error: message is not accessible here

🌍 2. Global Variable
->A variable defined outside of all functions and accessible anywhere in the code, including inside functions (unless overridden).

🔍 Example:
python
name = "Alice"  # global variable

def greet():
    print("Hi", name)

greet()  # Output: Hi Alice
🔔 To modify a global variable inside a function, use the global keyword:

count = 0

def increment():
    global count
    count += 1

increment()
print(count)  # Output: 1

🔄 3. Nonlocal Variable
->Used in nested functions to modify a variable from the outer (enclosing) function, but not global scope.

🔍 Example:

def outer():
    msg = "hello"

    def inner():
        nonlocal msg
        msg = "hi"

    inner()
    print(msg)

outer()  # Output: hi

Type	         Scope	Modification                  Keyword
Local	        Inside one function only	           None
Global	       Entire program	                     global
