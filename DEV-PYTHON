🐍 Python is a high-level, versatile programming language that's designed to be easy to read, write, and understand
-> Python is Dynamic :-No Type Declaration Needed You don’t need to say what type a variable is
EG:
x = 5         # Python treats 'x' as an integer
x = "hello"   # Now 'x' is a string
🧱 In Python, it requires indentation .
🐍Python Interpreter & Shell (REPL)
->Python is an interpreted language, which means it executes code line by line using an interpreter.
💻 Shell
Refers to the interface or tool where the REPL happens.
When you type python or python3 in the terminal and see >>>, you're inside the Python Shell.
🧪 REPL (Read–Eval–Print Loop)
REPL stands for:
📥 Read your input (the Python code you type)
🤖 Evaluate the code
📤 Print the result
🔁 Loop back and wait for the next command
